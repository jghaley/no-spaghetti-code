Usually we do our work on certain machines. People based at CERN would prefer lxplus while people based outside may prefer their local clusters or personal machines. Each individual may also have a different shell setup. It is very rare that the person who writes the code is the sole user. As a result, it is important to make sure the code can be used by others on a different machine/setup easily. 

It is really worth the time thinking about this as in the end if your code does not work for someone, you will likely receive an email or message asking for help:)
