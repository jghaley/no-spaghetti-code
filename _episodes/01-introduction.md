We work in a large collaboration so that we read/use each other's codes very often. Sadly but truly discussing coding is part of our lives (at least mine). No matter what is going on in this world, we talk (complain) about software often. Again at least for me:

Ok that is a bit exaggerated but software is indeed important for us. In this mini section we are not gonna tell you everything you need to know about writting elegant codes but rather share our experience working with software in ATLAS. Hopefully in the end we could convince you that it is worth thinking about this.
