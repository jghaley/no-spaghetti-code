## We need comments

Quotes from a colleague:

~~~
"I did something quick and dirty in my code, wrote it down in my notebook (physical notebook). Now I have problems when using my code and I want to check what I did before. Guess what, I left my notebook at CERN and I could not go back!"

An Instagram post from a friend when she was on VACATION:

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/ArtOne.jpg" alt="Art is everywhere?" width="50%" />

A snapshot from a piece of code written by a paranoid programmer:

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/Paranoid.png" alt="Art is everywhere!" width="50%" />

We should add comments where we are not sure whether what we are doing is correct (FIXME) or at places to conclude a loop/block. Also if we think we might be the only person on this planet writing such a block of code, we should probably add some comments. 

## Use easy to understand variable/file names

It is quite desperate to look for a variable named as "m" and figure out what it is doing. Unless it is an index or a counter or something similar.

We physicists like acronyms, they can be funny but we should make sure they are understandable when using them in our code.

Follow a certain naming convention can help a lot.
