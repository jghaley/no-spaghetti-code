## Materials from the ATLAS software team

The ATLAS computing team has many useful documenations (twiki pages, slides, notes, etc). Here is a list of them recommended by software experts:

1. [A nice twiki page on software quality](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasComputing/SoftwareQuality)
2. [A note on ATLAS C++ guidelines](http://atlas-computing.web.cern.ch/atlas-computing/projects/qa/draft_guidelines.pdf)
3. [A set of slides summarizing best C++ practice](https://indico.cern.ch/event/829411/contributions/3564510/attachments/1913272/3163600/2019-09-24-cxx.pdf)

Of course there are more available. If you have any questions you can also ask via the mailing lists: hn-atlas-PATHelp@cern.ch and hn-atlas-offlineSWHelp@cern.ch.
